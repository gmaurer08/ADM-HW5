    "Considering the requirements, the **Dijkstra algorithm** can satisfy most of the requirements because it effectively searches for the path with the fewest cost to reach the destination. However, the algorithm needs to be extended to account for the maximum number of stops k that Arya can make. To achieve this, we incorporate the missing constraint into the algorithm.<br>\n",
    "For efficient traversal, we can store the input list of flights as a graph using a dictionary, where each key represents a city code, and the value contains tuples of connected cities with their respective costs.<br>\n",
    "To ensure that the algorithm does not revisit nodes unnecessarily, we can use a dictionary to store the minimum cost to reach each city with a specific number of moves. This prevents redundant calculations and avoids exploring more expensive paths that have already been considered.<br>\n",
    "The algorithm starts with a list initialized to contain the starting city. Each entry in this list is represented as a tuple containing the total cost to reach the city, the city code, and the number of moves made so far. From the starting city, the algorithm iteratively explores paths to other cities. At each step, the city with the minimum cost is selected. If the number of moves required to reach that city exceeds the allowed k+1 stops, the path is considered invalid and discarded. If the city is the destination, the total cost to reach it is returned immediately.<br>\n",

Otherwise, the path information, such as cost and moves, is recorded in the dictionary tracking the minimum cost to reach cities. From the current city, all directly connected neighbors are added to the exploration list, along with their updated costs and move counts.<br>\n",

Since it loops over the cities_to_reach list, each city can be visited multiple times if it is reached with fewer costs or within a different number of flights. So, in the worst case, the while loop will iterate $( \\text{number of cities } n \\times \\text{maximum number of flights } (k+1) )$ times. Omitting the +1 , because it is less dominant, it iterates $( n \\times k )$ times, thus it has $( O(n \\cdot k) )$ as its complexity. Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Row (10): Has constant complexity.  \n",
    "- Rows (11)–(13): Iterate over the cities_to_reach list as well, so they also have $ O(n \\cdot k)$ as time complexity in the worst case.  \n",
    "- Rows (14)–(21): Have constant complexity.  \n",

    "- Row (24): Has constant complexity.  \n",

    "In summary, the while loop will have $ O((n \\cdot k)^2 + m) $ as its complexity, considering the worst-case scenario. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can combine it with the time complexity of the rows (3)–(6), which is $ O(m)$. However, it is less dominant compared to the while loop, so we are going to omit it. Thus, the final time complexity of the algorithm is $ O((n \\cdot k)^2 + m) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "There are essentially three elements that contribute the most to the space complexity of this algorithm: graph, min_cost and cities_to_reach.<br>\n",
    "The graph dictionary is based on the flights list, where each city points to a list of connected cities and their associated costs. Its space complexity can be represented as $( \\text{number of cities } n + \\text{number of connected flights } m )$.<br>\n",
    "The min_cost dictionary stores the diverse costs required to reach each city, depending on the city and stop combination. In the worst case, it will have $ n \\cdot (k+1)$ elementes. Simplifying this, it requires $O(n \\cdot k) $ space.<br>\n",
    "The cities_to_reach can grow to $O(n \\cdot k) $ as well, in the worst case, as each city can be visited up to k+1 times.<br>\n",
    "By combining all three components, the total space complexity becomes: $O(n+m+(n \\cdot k))$. Since $n \\cdot k $ dominates $n$, the final space complexity can be simplified to $O(m+(n \\cdot k))$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficiency analysis:\n",
    "Based on its time complexity and space complexity, we can deduce that when k (number of allowed stops) is small, the algorithm can work efficientyly, even with n>100, since $n \\cdot k$ will remain relatively manageable, avoiding runtime and memory overload. But, for large graphs with n>100 and k approaching n, the $ O((n \\cdot k)^2) $ term will make the algorithm computationally expensive. In addition, in the case of dense graphs with many edges, the $O(m)$ term will significantly impact both time and space complexity, making the algorithm impractical for such scenarios."

    "The suggestion provided by chatGPT seems mostly the same, the only difference lies in the use of a defaultdict as the data type of the graph, which simplifies its initialization. Consequentialy, we can say that the two algorithms are similar, or nearly identical, in terms of performance, time complexity and correctness:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The performance is the almost the same because the two algorithm share the same logic, both depend on the number of cities n, the number of flights m andthe maximum allowed stops k.\n",
    "-   Since the only optimization involves using a defaultdict instead of dict for graph, which is not the dominant part in the algorithm, the time complexities of the two algorithms remain the same: $O((n \\cdot k) \\cdot log(n \\cdot k))$.\n",
    "-   Both algorithms are correct, as they terminate when the destination city is reached with minimal cost. They also check and skip redundant or more expensive paths using the min_cost dictionary and process stops in the priority queue based on their cumulative cost, ensuring the optimal path is always chosen first."
